## 1. Overview

This repository documents an end-to-end machine learning project to predict diabetes. While the dataset is known to be synthetic, the primary focus of this analysis is a **critical investigation of its structure**.

The key discovery from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is that crucial lifestyle factors (like `smoking_status` and `alcohol_consumption`) show **no statistical correlation** with the diabetes diagnosis. This reveals the simplistic nature of the data generation algorithm, which likely relied only on direct medical metrics.

The project then proceeds to build a robust model based only on the features with genuine predictive power, and tunes it for a realistic clinical screening scenario.

## 2. Key Findings & Insights

-   **Revealed Simplistic Synthetic Generation:** The most critical insight from the EDA was that key lifestyle features (`smoking_status`, `alcohol_consumption`) and demographic data (`education_level`) had **no statistical correlation** with the diabetes diagnosis. This proved the data was generated by a simple algorithm based only on a few direct medical metrics, not a complex real-world simulation.

-   **Data Leakage Avoidance:** The analysis identified and removed proxy features like `diabetes_stage` and `diabetes_risk_score`. Including these would have led to a misleadingly perfect model, a classic data leakage mistake.

-   **Optimized for Clinical Relevance (High Recall):** A baseline model showed high precision but low recall (missing 13% of sick patients). By tuning the decision threshold using a Precision-Recall curve, the final model was optimized for a more practical screening scenario, achieving an improved **diabetes recall of 89%**.

-   **Achieved Robust 88% Accuracy:** The final, tuned model demonstrates strong predictive power using only a handful of core medical features (`HbA1c`, glucose levels, etc.), proving that intelligent feature selection was the key to building a meaningful model.

## 4. Setup and Usage

To replicate this analysis on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
The dataset is included, so you just need to clone the repository to get started.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/DarkSire7/Diabetes-prediction-model.git](https://github.com/DarkSire7/Diabetes-prediction-model.git)
cd Diabetes-prediction-model
````

###  Step 2: Set Up Environment & Install Dependencies

Using a virtual environment is a best practice.

```bash
# Create and activate the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyterlab
```

### Step 3: Run the Analysis

1.  **Start Jupyter Lab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
2.  **Run the Notebook:**
      - Open the `notebooks/diabetes_prediction_model.ipynb` file.
      - Run all the cells to execute the full analysis.
